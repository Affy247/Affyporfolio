    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi there! I'm Affyy, and I'm just starting my journey into web development. I don’t know everything yet — honestly, I’m still figuring a lot of it out — but I love the idea of making things that live on the internet.</p>
  <p>I built this portfolio using only HTML and CSS as part of my learning. It might be simple, but every line of code represents something new I’ve discovered.</p>
  <p>My goal? To keep growing, keep building, and maybe even surprise myself along the way.</p>
<br></br>
    <p>
      I'm a curious mind who's always loved creating, helping, and learning. As a microbiologist,
      I explored the tiny universe inside life — now, as an aspiring developer, I'm exploring
      the vast world of tech! I love how a few lines of code can turn into something useful,
      beautiful, and even life-changing. The more I code, the more I smile — it's like building magic with logic! ✨
    </p>
  
<br></br>

  <h2>Learning Journey</h2>
  <p>This is a record of what I've learned so far as I explore web development on my own. Every tag and style I use is a new step forward.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>📘 Learned how to structure web pages with HTML5 elements like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code></li>
    <li>🎨 Practiced styling using CSS — fonts, colors, padding, and layout basics</li>
    <li>📱 Started learning about responsiveness with media queries</li>
    <li>💻 Tried out Git and GitHub to track and share my code, although I still need so much help</li>
    <li>🛠 Built this portfolio from scratch using only HTML and CSS</li>
  </ul>

    <h2>Meet Me</h2>
    <p>
      I studied Microbiology (B.Tech) and discovered how scientific thinking shapes the world.
      I'm currently transitioning into tech because I believe science + software = superpower. 💥
      Here’s me in the lab — curious and focused:

  <h2>Practice Makes Progress</h2>
  <p>Here are a few things I’ve built or experimented with while learning HTML and CSS. They may be simple, but each one helped me understand something new.</p>

  <div class="project-card">
    <h3>📄 This Portfolio Website</h3>
    <p>Built from scratch with just HTML and CSS. I learned about semantic structure, text formatting, and responsive layout.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="project-card">
    <h3>📬 Contact Form</h3>
    <p>I created a basic HTML form with labels, inputs, and a submit button. It helped me understand accessibility and input types.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="project-card">
    <h3>🃏 Responsive Card Layout</h3>
    <p>Practiced CSS layout and responsiveness by building card-style sections that adapt on smaller screens.</p>
  </div>

    <h2>What Excites Me About Tech</h2>
    <ul>
    
      <li>Turning problems into projects (and bugs into bragging rights 🐞 ➡️ ✅)</li>
      <li>Making tools that help real people</li>
      <li>Building things from nothing — like a coding magician 🪄</li>
    <li>I may not know much yet, but I *do* know that I love making things — even small things.</li>
    <li>There's just something exciting about turning a blank screen into a working idea.</li>
    <li>Honestly? I don't know how long I’ll last in tech — but every day I try, it pulls me in deeper.</li>
    <li>Who knows? My interest might one day lead me to build an app, or... maybe even a robot that tells me to rest 😅</li>
    <li>Either way, I'm curious, I’m learning, and I’m loving the process — one keystroke at a time.</li>
  </ul>
  <div></div>

  <h2>What I'm Working Toward</h2>
  <p>Right now, I'm focused on understanding the basics of HTML and CSS. My next steps include learning more about responsive design, accessibility, and how to build forms that actually work using backend tools someday.</p>
  <p>Eventually, I’d love to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>🌱 Build more structured websites from scratch</li>
    <li>🤝 Contribute to beginner-friendly open-source projects</li>
    <li>⚡ Learn JavaScript to make things interactive</li>
    <li>🏁 Join a hackathon team and build something fun</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I'm not rushing the journey — I'm here to enjoy learning and creating as I go.</p>

<h2>Fun me</h2>
  <h4>Fun Facts About My Learning</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>🗂 I once had five copies of the same folder... because I wasn’t sure where “Save As” sent it.</li>
    <li>🧭 Git Bash still feels like a maze — sometimes I end up in folders I didn’t know existed.</li>
    <li>📁 I accidentally created a folder inside a folder inside a folder. I called it “Final-Final-Version-REAL”.</li>
    <li>🔄 My favorite Git command? <code>clear</code> — because it always works and makes me feel in control.</li>
    <li>🫠 I once deleted an entire GitHub repo because somewhere between commits, pushes, and errors… I couldn’t even get a working link anymore.</li>
    <li>🙃 Sometimes I fix things by deleting the whole folder and starting fresh. Feels illegal but it works.</li>
  </ul>
